Operate and control a remote control car using a control board ( STM32F401 )

# Functional Unit
1. UART:
   A serial communication protocol used for data exchange between a computer and peripheral devices such as microcontrollers and modules. It does not require a synchronous clock signa.
2. PWM:
   A technique used to simulate an analog signal using a digital signal by varying the width of pulses.
3. ADC:
   A module that converts analog signals into digital data.
4. TIMER:
   A technique used to simulate an analog signal using a digital signal by varying the width of pulses.
